# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A condition statement would take a statement and evaluate to see if it is true. There is the if/else conditional statement. You will write a code and see if it comes out true or not. If it comes true or false you will have the computer output a result.

  Researched answer: Basically when you are creating a conditional statement you're telling the computer to read and evaluate a statement. The computer would read if it's true or false. If the condition comes out true then it will execute the code block. If it's false then it would go down to the next condition and read it and execute code block if it comes true.



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a software that runs in your local computer. You can use it to go behind the scenes with coding. The difference between git and Github is that Github is remote whole git is local. Any information that you have on your laptop won't be in the cloud where Github is. Vice versa. What's on Github won't be on your personal computer. You can push or pull files into Github.

  Researched answer: Git is a version control system that is built into most laptops. Github is a hosting service that allows people to manager their repositories better. You can think of Github as a platform where you could share a copy of your repositories. Git can perform command line tool.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Boolean is one of the many primitive data types and spits out true or false. There are three types of operators that will evaluate whether the code is true or false. There is the "Rational Operators" that is normally a carrot sign with or without an equal sign accompanying, depends on what you're trying to achieve. (<, >, <=, =>) Then there is the "Logical Operators" which are &&, ||, and !. In that order, there is the AND operator, and OR operator, and BANG operator. The last one that we have is, strict and loose equality, or known as double or triple equal signs.

  Researched answer: There are a couple of operators that will give you the boolean value which are true and false. There is the Rational and Logical operators. The relational will evaluate the relationship between two datatypes and see if its true. There is the logical it basically puts two complete statements together. If you're using the AND operator then both sides must be true. The OR as long as one side is true will return true. There is the strict and loose eqaulity. the loose will convert the data types before it evaluates, while the strict requires both data types to be the same.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An array is a collection of data that is in a list inside a square bracket and seperated by commas. Just like this [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Each number that you see inside the square brackets are called items/element. If you were to count what was inside the swaure bracket it would be a total of 5 items. Each element has it's own values and assigned index. Index would be the position of the value. It starts at 0. So at index 0 the value is 2. At index 1 the value is 3. S on.

  Researched answer: Index is the position of the value. The difference between a value and index is that the index will tell you where each value is located. The value is the inside content of an element.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is when a code is being pushed through a loop. In for loops you can see it happening the most. I'm not sure what it is completely.

  Researched answer: Interation is basically when you repeat a code over and over again till a condition is met.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is an interaction between two people and each have a role. The roles are driving and navigating. One person will be the "driver" and with remote learning. They would share their screen so that the other person would see. The driver would be responsible for typing out some codes. When one person is driving the other person is the "navigator". They will normally catch mistakes that the driver misses. Pair programming gives each person the experience of working with a partner and collaborating. Both will contribute ideas. Every 20-30 minutes or so you would switch roles so both get to be a driver or navigator.

  Researched answer: Two programmers work together and they both have a role. If you're the driver you are the one that puts in the code. If you are the navigator you will check code and observe. Roles will be switched often.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: so it works off a function rather than data types and that is why they call it the higher order function. 

2. Jest: jest is basically a test runner that will create, run and structure tests.

3. Objects: object could be like a cup. the cup is the object and the features would be the properties of the object.

4. Method: methods are what can be performed on objects.

5. Classes: classes are a special type of function that creates a template for objects.
